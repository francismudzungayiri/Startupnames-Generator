Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final.

Stateful widgets maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget. 
Implementing a stateful widget requires at least two classes: 
1) a StatefulWidget that creates an instance of a State class. 
The StatefulWidget object is, itself, immutable and can be thrown away and 
regenerated, but the State object persists over the lifetime of the widget.
